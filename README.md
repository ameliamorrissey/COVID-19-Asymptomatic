# COVID-19-Asymptomatic

This project was another collaboration with my research partner Xinyi Cheng. We worked on this project in advisement from Professor Dylan Shepardson, former CDC disease modeler, and current academic in disease modeling. Professor Shepardson provided instruction with the initial theoretical basis for the SIR disease model, and Xinyi and I conducted a literature review, data search and validation, statistical analysis, and created a novel variation on the base SIR model that was tailored to the 2019 Corona Virus outbreak, and which (unlike many models that were circulating at the time) accounted for asymptomatic cases based on antibody testing data. We then compared our model to the symptomatic case data that we found and cleaned from the NYC Public Health ongoing reports. Please find more information in the paper uploaded here.
